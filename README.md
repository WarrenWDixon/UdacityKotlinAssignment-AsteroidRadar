# NASA Asteroid App
This project was a programming assignment for the Udacity Android Developer program.
This app uses two NASA APIs, one to get the image of the day, the other to get a list of asteroids coming close to Earth.
The app uses RetroFit for the fetching the data from NASA and stores data in a Room database.
A demo api key is included so this app should run out of the box.
